# Caesar's

## Description

A full stack mobile app for the hottest bar on the block, Caesar's. 
Customer can login and order their favourite items.
A restaurant user can check and confirm the order.
Once complete, the customer receives an SMS notification from the restaurant.

This was a group project with 
* [Betty](https://github.com/BettyHoPro)
* [Judit](https://github.com/judelt)
* [Luke](https://github.com/luke-yin)

I intergrated PostgreSql database and data modelling, routing, Twilio API implementation, and designing the menu.

### Navigate, select, and place order using the app.
